# blog-app
My first app connected to an online database. It allows to create posts with text and images. It implements user authentication and authorization, as well as basic security.

## Motivation
I was coursing the back-end lessons of [The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), which among other things taught me about REST apps. 
At the same time I was also doing a course on Bootstrap ([Bootstrap 4 From Scratch With 5 Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/bootstrap-4-from-scratch-with-5-projects/)), and I came across a Bootstrap exercise with 3 very clear resources (posts, users & categories) and various CRUD operations for them. 
It felt like adding the logic to that Bootstrap exercise (it had only the front-end) would make a perfect way to practice REST apps.

## Main Tech Used
- Back-end: Node.js, Express, MongoDB & EJS templating.
- Front-end: JQuery, Bootstrap, HTML & CSS.
